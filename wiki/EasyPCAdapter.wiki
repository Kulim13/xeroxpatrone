#Really easy to build PC Adapter

= Howto? =

The whole schematic is stolen from [http://www.lancos.com/webtherm.html here] and [http://www.riccibitti.com/pc_therm.htm here]. Download the simplified schematics with usb-power [http://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/schaltplan.png here].

The parts are really cheap to buy for the z-Diodes you can use for example MMSZ5V1 or 1N751ATR 5,1V 500mW.
