#summary Really easy to build PC Adapter

= Howto? =

The whole schematic is stolen from [http://www.lancos.com/webtherm.html here] and [http://www.riccibitti.com/pc_therm.htm here]. Download the simplified schematics with usb-power [http://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/easy_adapter.png here].

The parts are really cheap to buy for the z-Diodes you can use for example MMSZ5V1 or 1N751ATR 5,1V 500mW.

The USB connection is only used to provide power to the EEPROM chip. The Data flows still through the RS232 connection.
