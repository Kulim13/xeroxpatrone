= Cartridges for Ricoh Afico Printers =

The cartridges have some small pcb mounted. Excerpt of a mail describing the findings:

{{{
  The cartridge has a counter PCB. Mounted to the PCB is a M24C01WP 
  EEPROM from STMicroelectronics, wired for chip address 1 (A0 
  connected to VCC, A1 and A2 connected to GND).
  A connector with 2 mm pin spacing is used to connect the PCB 
  to the printer electronics. 

  The connections are:

  Pin   Signal
  --------------
   1    GND
   2    SDA
   3    SCL
   4    +5V
   5    GND
   6    GND
}}}

Please note, when flashing the cartridges, there seems to be a serial number encoded into it. You may have to change this. For example for the eeprom dump available [http://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/ricoh_aficio_ap610n_black.bin here] has the serial number `A7270102061`. 

A hexdump of it looks like this:
